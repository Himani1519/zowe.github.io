    Zowe V3 Release will be delayed from March 28. The Zowe V2 release schedule will be adjusted to accommodate this change. We expect to have a new V3 release date and further information on V2 by the end of March and will notify you at that time.
    
    We are sorry for the inconvenience. During the due diligence phase in preparing for the V3 release, we discovered the dependent package support policies and subsequent requirements changed, therefore we need to perform further evaluation prior to releasing.
    
- announcement: Zowe v3 is going GA on 2024/03/28
